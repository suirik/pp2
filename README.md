#  PP2 PROJECT

**Source:** W3Schools Python Tutorial  

---

##  Project Overview
* This repository is created to practice **basic Python syntax** and **Git workflow**.
* It follows the structure required for the **W3Schools "Topics to Cover"** assignment.

---

##  Project Structure

### **1. Practice 1: Python Basics**
* `hello_world.py` — Basic output examples.
* `variables.py` — Variable declaration and assignment.
* `data_types.py` — Demonstration of different Python data types.
* `strings.py` — String manipulation and methods.
* `numbers.py` — Working with integers and floats.

---

### **2. Practice 2: Control Flow & Logic**
In this section, I implemented more complex logic to make programs dynamic.

#### ** Boolean & Comparison**
* **`boolean/`** — Learning how to evaluate expressions to `True` or `False`.
* Using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not` to combine conditions.

#### ** Conditionals (If...Else)**
* **`if_else/`** — Implementing decision-making paths.
* Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to handle multiple scenarios in the code.

#### ** Loops & Iteration**
* **`loops/`** — Automating repetitive tasks with `for` and `while` loops.
* **Loop Control**: Using `break` to exit a loop and `continue` to skip an iteration.
