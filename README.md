PP2: Python Programming Coursework
This repository contains the laboratory works and practice assignments for the Python Programming 2 course. The project is organized into modular directories based on the curriculum progression.

📂 Project Structure
Practice 1: Python Fundamentals

Concepts: Basic syntax, data types, and variable manipulation.

Key Files:

hello_world.py: Basic output operations.

variables.py: Variable declaration and assignment.

data_types.py: Working with integers, strings, and floats.

strings.py: String formatting and concatenation.

Practice 2: Control Flow and Logic

Concepts: Decision making, logical comparisons, and iterative processes.

Directories:

boolean/: Evaluation of expressions (True/False).

if_else/: Conditional branching logic.

loops/: Iteration using for and while loops, including loop control (break, continue).

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Git Workflow

The repository history demonstrates proficiency in version control management, including:

Directory restructuring and modularization.

Conflict resolution and branch synchronization.

Professional commit messaging.

Python Standards

All scripts follow PEP 8 guidelines for readability and utilize modern Python features such as:

F-strings for dynamic output.

Boolean logic for efficient conditional checks.

Iterative logic for data collection processing.

🚀 How to Use
